### Hi. I'm Flipse ğŸ‘‹

..and I never left Tumblr. ğŸ˜Œ I'm 100% of the time the creator my own existential crisis, and also Tumblr desktop themes. On here you will _mostly_ find the files to my themes, but I do write the occasional how-to tumblr-related guides as well.

- âš¡ I've been on tumblr since 2009 ğŸ¥¸
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently ~~trying to get better~~ learning Javascript 
- ğŸ“« You can contact me via [Tumblr](https://lushwave.tumblr.com/) or [Elsewhere](https://beacons.ai/flipse)
#### Looking for my premium themes?
They are available to buy on [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/flipse).
