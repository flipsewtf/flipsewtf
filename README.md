### Hi. I'm Flipse 👋

I’m 100% responsible for my own existential crises, just so we're all aware. 😌  
I began my journey with b2/cafelog and "online diaries" (before the term *blog* was coined) around 1999/2000, complete with a domain, webrings, and fanlistings 🎉

From 2006–2012 I didn’t really touch this creative side, but since 2012 I’ve mainly specialized in **Tumblr themes**. Lately, I’ve been exploring elsewhere with **11ty**, **Neocities**, and general fun stuff on the web.

- ⚡ On Tumblr since 2009 🥸  
- 🌱 Currently learning **JavaScript**, **11ty**, and **Nunjucks**  
- 🌻 Passionate about building **accessible web stuff** <3
- ☄️ I am into astrophysics and quantum physics on a hobby-based level
