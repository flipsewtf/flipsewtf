### Hi. I'm Flipse 👋

I began my journey with b2/cafelog and "online diaries" (before the term _blog_ was coined) around 1999/2000, complete with a domain, webrings, and fanlistings.

From 2012 I’ve been making Tumblr themes while attempting to wrangle their quirks and _interesting_ choices of code. As of late 2025 I decided that Tumblr was neither my circus nor my monkeys.

Currently untangling years of - let's be honest - questionable JavaScript habits, courtesy of Tumblr. I’ve been exploring elsewhere with **Astro** and the indie web.
