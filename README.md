### Hi. I'm Flipse ğŸ‘‹

..and I never left Tumblr. ğŸ˜Œ I'm 100% of the time the creator my own existential crisis, and, also Tumblr desktop themes. On here you will _mostly_ find the files to my themes, but I do write the occasional how-to tumblr-related guides, as well as some JS snippets.

- âš¡ I've been on tumblr since 2009 ğŸ¥¸
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently ~~aiming at getting better at~~ learning Javascript
- ğŸŒ» My goal is to make accessible themes <3
  
#### Looking for my premium themes?
They are available to buy on [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/flipse).
