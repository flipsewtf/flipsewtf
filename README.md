### Hi. I'm Flipse 👋

I began my journey with b2/cafelog and "online diaries" (before the term _blog_ was coined) around 1999/2000, complete with a domain, webrings, and fanlistings 🎉

From 2006–2012, I didn’t really touch this creative side, but since 2012 I’ve been making Tumblr themes while attempting to wrangle their ever-changing quirks and interesting choices of code. As of late 2025, I’ve walked away from that circus.

Lately, I’ve been exploring elsewhere with **Astro**, **Neocities**, and general fun stuff on the web. Currently untangling years of - let's be honest - questionable JavaScript habits, courtesy of Tumblr.
